# @plico-ai/sdk

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cfd453f: First public developer preview of Plico, a TypeScript-first agent app kit. A folder of Markdown instructions, skills, TypeScript tools, config, evals, memory and artifacts becomes a runnable, inspectable agent app.
  
  - Start a project with `npm create plico`, then use `plico validate`, `plico run`, `plico eval`, `plico readiness` and `plico serve --studio`.
  - Every run is recorded in a durable event log, with approvals, cancel, threads, artifacts and OpenTelemetry tracing.
  - Embed Plico in your backend with `createPlico` from `@plico-ai/server`. Write tools and config with `defineTool` and `defineConfig` from `@plico-ai/sdk`.
  - Needs Node 22.18 or later.
  
  What may change: this is a `0.x` release, so the TypeScript exports of every package can change in any minor version. The HTTP API under `/v1` takes additive changes only from this release on; a breaking change would be `/v2`. Saved data such as events and eval reports carries its own `schemaVersion`.
